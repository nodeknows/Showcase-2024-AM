        <h1>THE BIRTH OF JURASSIC COLLECTION</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="intro">
        <h2>INTRODUCING.. US!</h2>
        <p>The Jurassic Collection emerged from a deep passion for adventure, fascination with prehistoric wonders, and
            a commitment to providing unforgettable experiences. Inspired by the timeless allure of Jurassic Park, our
            founders embarked on a journey to create a one-of-a-kind hotel experience that would transport guests to a
            world where dinosaurs roam once again. Combining creativity, innovation, and a hint of magic, the Jurassic
            Collection was born.</p>

            <h2>SINCE THE BEGINNING</h2>
            <p>Jurassic Resort was our originally, baseline hotel derived from the Jurassic Park experience. It is our
                foundational brand, and over the ensuring years, it has been evolved and refurbished to modern-day
                standardized quality. You, the guest, are the very heart of it all.</p>

            <h2>THE JURASSIC DREAM</h2>
            <p>
                We learned that our primary goal was to provide a beautiful, safe, and comforting experience for our
                customers, you! Over the years, we have also learned that we have previously faced such challenges. It
                is not easy being the mainstream hotel collection that Isla Nublar relies on, but we are grateful to be
                in such a position. We strive harder, day after day, to give you the best out of your stay; no strings
                attached.</p>
